# Refectoring SEO Website

## Description

To ensure 'Horiseon - Social Solution Services' webpage is accessible to all users I refactored 'index.html' file to include semantic elements. These elements contain 'alt' description for images, along with header, main, article, section and footer tags. This revision of 'index.html' will optimize the webpage's accessibility for individuals reliant on screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Additionally, the 'style.css' was changed to follow the principles of DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) rule, which grouped and eliminated some code lines that were used more than once, resulting in greater efficiency and maintainability.
